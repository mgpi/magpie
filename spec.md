# MAGPIE

## Introduction

Magpie is inspired by K, Lua, Torch7 and IPython and is aimed at prototyping 

It has numbers (32 or 64 bit floating point numbers on CPU or GPU), symbols (used for Unicode characters and interned strings), functions, assoociative arrays, objects and tables.

Magpie compiles into Lua for efficient execution via Luajit and into Javascript for UI elements.
